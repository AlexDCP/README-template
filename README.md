# README-template

## Description

This project was meant to create a readme generator that uses inquirer and node.js to prompt the user on the backend to be able to do so.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)

## Installation

In order to run the functions th user will need to use 'nmp i' in the terminal to have it run the prompts.

## Usage

To get the prompts to start, path into the root folder and run node index.js.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
